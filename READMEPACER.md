## Introduction

The core objective of this work is the development of a flexible, efficient, and verifiable computational pacemaker cell model that is essential for designing real-time virtual hearts. These virtual hearts are intended for the closed-loop validation of cardiac devices. The proposed framework supports device testing within an in-silico closed-loop context of patient physiology.

### Background

Traditional biophysically-based heart models rely on coupled differential equations, making them computationally costly to solve and unsuitable for real-time emulation or formal verification. 
To overcome this challenge while retaining dynamic physiological features, the models utilize the Hybrid Automaton (HA) formalism. 
HA models retain computational efficiency while supporting the modeling of continuous membrane voltage evolution and distinct action potential phases.

The heart is represented as an abstracted network of nodes (regional tissue clusters) connected by edges.

![Abstracted heart model ](./images/Abstracted_heart_model.png)[[3]](https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2019.2917212)

### Model Descriptions

The heart model is organized into libraries, models, and scripts. Each component is designed for specific role.  
- The **Lib/** folder contains the core component libraries, including cellular models (pacemaker, myocyte, and subsidiary pacemaker cells), conduction paths, EGM sensing modules, and pacemaker devices, with separate versions for millisecond- and second-based simulations. 
- The **models/**  provides pre-built examples, ranging from single-cell pacemaker models to full heart simulations, allowing users to quickly run simulations or test specific scenarios. 
- For more detailed or high-resolution variants, the **models_refine/**  contains complex heart models with increased numbers of nodes and paths. 
- The **src/**  hosts all utility scripts, including automatic model builders, configuration processors, GUI tools, plotting functions, and parameter generators, enabling users to customize and automate simulations. 

#### Model Libraries

Two versions of library exist: **Libs.slx** & **Libs_second.slx** (Seconds) Same components but adapted for second based simulation for hardware integration ([Notes on Modification from Milliseconds (ms) to Seconds](#notes-on-modification-from-milliseconds-ms-to-seconds)).

#### Notes on Modification from Milliseconds (ms) to Seconds 

The model was originally developed using **milliseconds (ms)** as the simulation time.  
For hardware integration, it has been modified to use **seconds (s)**. The key modifications are:

- **Node_N_V6 / Automaton / function rr=RR(...) / line 27:**   `y =bff'*2*pi*pt`: removed `/1000` in **Libs_second.slx**.
- **Sensing / Chart and Sensing / Chart3:**  
  Use `temporalCount(msec)` and `after(3,msec)` in **Libs_second.slx**.  
  In **Libs.slx**, the original code uses `temporalCount(sec)` and `after(3,sec)`.
- **Libs_second / Path_V3 / Path (Buffer_i and Buffer_j):**  
  Thresholds changed: `tbi >= 599` → `tbi >= 0.599`, `tbj >= 599` → `tbj >= 0.599`.  
  Note: This only affects action potentials where APD > 600 ms.
- **CLK Modules (inputs to Sensing, Pre_eventsv1, Ratesv1, Cnds_DDDv1, PMTv1, PM_DDD_v3):**  
  Set `Period(secs) = 0.001`.
- **Timing parameters of sensing and pacemaker modules:**  
  Remain the same (use ms).
- Use **Heart_N3_second.xlsx**, which contains modified parameters for simulation time in seconds.


## Getting Started  

### Add the library files to the path

Before running any simulations, add all library files to the MATLAB® search path for the current session. This ensures that all models, scripts, and utility functions are accessible. Run:
```matlab
>> setup_Heart
```
### Run model simulations  

All the running examples are under the directory *models* or *models_refine*, firstly go to the directory by clicking the folder or running the following in the Matlab command window:     
```matlab
>> cd models
```
**1. Automaticity simulation of pacemaker cell models**  

Pacemaker cells can initiate action potentials without external stimulation.

 In the folder, there are three pacemaker cell models: <BR/>(1) SA node model "**SAcell.slx**",<BR/>(2) AV node model "**CNcell.slx**", and <BR/> (3) His-Purkinje fibre cell "**HPScell.slx**".

 To simulate the models: <BR/> 1.Open a cell model and click "Run" button in Simulink or run the simulation using the Matlab commands:

```matlab
>> open('SAcell.slx') 
>> sim('SAcell.slx')
```
2.Once the simulation finishes, click the scope to view the output trace. 
	
![SAN Action Potential](./images/SA_AP.png)![AVN Action Potential](./images/AVN_AP.png)![HPS Action Potential](./images/HPS_AP.png)

**2. Overdrive suppression simulation**

If a pacemaker cell is depolarized at a higher frequency than its intrinsic rate, its automaticity may be suppressed, which is known as overdrive suppression.
![Overdrive suppression ](./images/Overdrive_suppression.png)
Here an external stimuli is applied to a pacemaker cell to demonstrate this effect.  
The model **AV.slx** is preconfigured with a pulse input, and the script **simAV_Trace.m** is provided to run the simulation.

1.Run the following in the Matlab command window:  
```matlab
>> simAV_Trace
```
2.Once the simulation finishes, **Plottrace.m** can be used to plot the simulation traces:       
```matlab
>> Plottrace 
```
**3. Run a heart model without external pacing pulses**	  

This section describes how to simulate the full heart model operating under its intrinsic rhythm, without any external pacing stimulation.

1.Open HeartExe.slx and click "Run" in Simulink, or run the following in the Matlab command window:     
```matlab
>>open('HeartExe.slx')
>>sim('HeartExe.slx')
```
2.Once the simulation finishes, the specified action potentials can be printed out by running the following in the Matlab command window:          
```matlab
>> load('Cells.mat')     
>> plotCells
```
![action_potentials ](./images/action_potentials.png)

**4. Run a heart model with a pacemaker device**  
Run the following in the Matlab command window:         
  ```matlab
>> cd ..
>> RunCLSfixed     
```

## Need-to-know
* In the path model, only the voltage during q3 contribute to the activation of its neighbouring cells, which is an approximation.
* If the action potential of a cardiomyocyte is greater than the VO during q3 location at given parameters, e.g., out of the physiological range, the output would be saturated to VO. A better saturation approach can be found in the references [5,6], which only saturates the overshoot at the end of q2.
* The models are implemented to facilitate parameterization. The parameters can be updated at run time. For fixed parameters application, the implementation can be simplified. Please refer to the papers [1-4] for the model descriptions.
* The GUI is not fully tested.
